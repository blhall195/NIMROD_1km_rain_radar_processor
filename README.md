# NIMROD_1km_rain_radar_processor
This MATLAB script processes 1 km resolution composite data from the Met Office's UK rainfall radars via the Met Office NIMROD system into timeseries image files. The pixel colour relates to the total rainfall in each km tile. Individual NIMROD files must be uncompressed before they can be processed, input the co-ordinates for the bounding box limits you would like to see the rainfall data for the images will then be outputted into a directory of your choice.

Repo also includes code that allows you to plot rainfall within a catchemnt area (red bounding box) on a bar chart.
